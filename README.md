## Quick start

Welcome to these projects, which serve as a showcase of my proficiency in finance, programming, and econometrics. By exploring these projects, you'll gain insights into my skills and expertise in these domains. Whether you're interested in finance, programming, or the intersection of both with econometrics and machine learning, these projects aim to demonstrate my capabilities and provide practical examples of my work.

To begin, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the structure and content of these projects. Each project is designed to highlight different aspects of my competence and expertise. You will find a diverse range of topics, methodologies, and techniques employed throughout these projects.

As you navigate through the projects, feel free to explore the code, data analysis, and any accompanying documentation provided. This will give you a comprehensive understanding of the depth and breadth of my abilities in financial engineering, risk management, portfolio management, and econometrics.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss specific aspects of the projects, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am open to feedback, suggestions, and collaborations to further enhance these projects and contribute to their ongoing development.

## Status
